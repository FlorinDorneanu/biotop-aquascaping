# Biotope Aquascaping
## Milestone Project One
Biotope Aquascaping is a business concept that brings together the love for aquatic plants, nature and fish keeping. Aquascape aquariums are beneficial to physical and mental wellbeing and can have a positive, calming, stress-relieving effect on both their owners and viewers. Bioptope Aquascaping offers their services to rebuild the clients' old aquariums or create new ones in places like private houses, offices, dentist cabinets, restaurants, or wherever the conditions are favorable. Based on years of experience and learning from their mistakes, Biotope Aquascape can design and build clients' future aquariums from the ground up. The purpose of the website is for them to be easily reached and also to share information about them and what they do.
