# Biotope Aquascaping
## Milestone Project One
Biotope Aquascaping is a business concept that brings together the love for aquatic plants, nature and fish keeping. Aquascape aquariums are beneficial to physical and mental wellbeing and can have a positive, calming, stress-relieving effect on both their owners and viewers. Bioptope Aquascaping offers their services to rebuild the clients' old aquariums or create new ones in places like private houses, offices, dentist cabinets, restaurants, or wherever the conditions are favorable. Based on years of experience and learning from their mistakes, Biotope Aquascape can design and build clients' future aquariums from the ground up. The purpose of the website is for them to be easily reached and also to share information about them and what they do.

## Surface

### Colour

This website was requested to have a simple yet visually appealing design. To keep up with the request, two colours were used throughout the site: Teal(#008080) and White(#FFF). These colours go perfect with the aquatic theme that was chosen.

### Imagery

The images chosen for the "Services" page were taken from [this website]() to showcase exactly what every type of decorated aquarium could look like for the users to get not only readble information but also a visual example. The background image(banner image) was taken from [Envato]() and it was chosen for the nice contrast and to to keep up with the theme of the website.

### Typography

For fonts, https://fonts.google.com/ has been used. For headings, "Source Sans Pro" has been chosen and for the content, "Poppins" font was chosen because it goes perfectly with the "Source Sans Pro" font and it gives the website a modern and playful vibe. Letter spacing was increased in some places to make the text more defined and to stand out.

This code was imported at the top of the style.css file:
```
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300&family=Source+Sans+Pro&display=swap');
```

### Call to Action
* The navigation bar in the header section are highlighted with a nice hover effect: an underline that start from the left side and goes for 0.4 seconds to the right side when the mouse is hovered over them.
* On the Home page, a "Services" button has been added for the user to easily access it when entering the website. For consistency reasons, the button has the same effect as the navigation links.
* The "Send" button from the contact form was styled white with black text for contrast purposes.
* The colour "Teal" was used for styling the social links. The media links will send the use to "Biotope Aquascaping" social media pages.
