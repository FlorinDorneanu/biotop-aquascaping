            <h2>Decreases Blood Pressure <i class="fa-solid fa-hand-holding-medical"></i></h2>
            <p>
                Multiple studies and experiments have shown that watching a fish tank, or even just a tank with aquatic plants and other naturistic elements 
                can reduce the blood pressure of those viewing it. The impacts are seen to especially improve the heart health of the elderly in comparison 
                to other age ranges. This research has also shown that the more species of plants and fish the aquarium has, the more of a calming and 
                relaxing effect it creates on those around it. Some of the results even revealed as high as a 4% reduction in blood pressure.

            <h2>Lowers Heart Rate <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse"></i></h2>
            <p>
                Similar to decreasing blood pressure, staring at aquariums can also slow your heart rate. According to the same study mentioned previously, 
                observers of fishless aquascapes decreased heart rates by 3%, while aquariums stocked with fish resulted in drop rates as much as 7%.
                Fish tanks are great for people with high blood pressure and heart rate or other heart-related issues. The naturistic d√©cor helps to keep 
                your stress levels down, which in turn will help you maintain a healthy lifestyle!

            <h2>Improves Sleep Quality <i class="fa-solid fa-bed"></i></h2>
            <p>
                Sleep doesn't come easy for everyone. Having an aquarium in the bedroom has proven to help people fall asleep. The relaxing, trickling sounds 
                of water flowing from the filter and back into the tank is very soothing. It's similar to people playing recordings of rainfall or a running
                 river in order to help themselves fall asleep. The sound of moving water typically calms people down. The sounds coming from an aquarium can
                  also provide white noise, meaning they will block out other potential disruptive noises, helping you stay asleep.
                  In addition, the visuals of the fish tank itself can be relaxing. Staring at the aquarium fish gracefully swimming around the aquarium can
                   help lull those having a hard time falling asleep.

            <h2>Reduces Anxiety <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile"></i></h2>
            <p>
                Along with the reduction of stress, aquariums can also help lower anxiety. Fish tanks can arguably serve as a calming distraction. Looking into 
                the tank and observing its inhabitants helps people forget about their present worries for a moment. Their focus is shifted from whatever is 
                causing their anxiousness to fascination of the aquatic creatures in front of them. A study showed that the anxiety level of participants in a 
                room with an aquarium was lowered by an average of 12%.
